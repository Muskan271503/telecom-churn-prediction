# Telecom Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction helps telecom companies identify customers who are likely to leave, allowing them to take proactive measures to retain them.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains customer information such as demographics, account details, and service usage patterns. The target variable indicates whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0).

### Features include:
- Customer demographics (e.g., gender, age, tenure)
- Subscription details (e.g., contract type, monthly charges, total charges)
- Service usage (e.g., internet service, streaming services, phone service)
- Customer support interactions (e.g., number of customer service calls)

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Notebook/IDE:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Data visualization (correlation heatmaps, distribution plots)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Checking for class imbalance

## 📊 Model Training & Evaluation
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train multiple machine learning models
- Evaluate models using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization
